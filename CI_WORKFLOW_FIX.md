# CI Workflow Fix

## Workflow Run Analysis

**Failed Workflow Run:** [#18454792307](https://github.com/austenstone/copilot-cli-actions/actions/runs/18454792307)
- **Workflow:** CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Status:** Failed
- **Conclusion:** failure
- **Run Number:** 64
- **Triggered by:** Push to main branch
- **Commit:** 6f2b4866cec261b0cf63612fc5067348d74951ca

## Error Details

### Failed Job: build
- **Job Status:** failure
- **Runner:** ubuntu-latest

### Failed Step
- **Step Name:** Run exit 1
- **Step Number:** 3
- **Conclusion:** failure
- **Error:** Command `exit 1` intentionally caused workflow failure

## Root Cause

The CI workflow contains an intentional failure command on line 16:
```yaml
- run: exit 1
```

This command causes the workflow to exit with a non-zero status code, resulting in a failed workflow run.

## Recommended Fix

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file should be updated as follows:

### Current Code (Lines 9-16):
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - run: echo "Hello, world!"
      - run: exit 1
```

### Proposed Fix:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - run: echo "Hello, world!"
      - run: echo "CI workflow completed successfully"
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed** the intentional failure command `exit 1` (line 16)
2. **Uncommented** the `actions/checkout@v5` step to ensure proper repository access
3. **Added** a success message to confirm workflow completion

## Implementation Notes

⚠️ **Important:** The provided GitHub token (`github-actions[bot]`) does not have the `workflows` permission required to push changes to workflow files. 

To implement this fix, you will need to:

1. Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `workflow` scope, OR
2. Manually create a pull request with the changes, OR
3. Grant the `workflows` permission to the GitHub App/token being used

## Testing

After implementing the fix:
1. The CI workflow should complete successfully
2. All steps should show green checkmarks
3. The workflow run should have a "success" conclusion

## Error Logs Summary

```
Step: Run exit 1
Status: completed
Conclusion: failure
Started: 2025-10-13T04:05:25Z
Completed: 2025-10-13T04:05:25Z
```

The workflow failed as expected due to the `exit 1` command. No other errors were present in the workflow execution.
