# CI Workflow Failure Analysis

## Failed Workflow Details

- **Workflow Run:** https://github.com/austenstone/copilot-cli-actions/actions/runs/18384638002
- **Job Name:** build
- **Conclusion:** failure
- **Workflow:** CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Root Cause

The CI workflow contains an intentional failure on line 16:

```yaml
steps:
  # - uses: actions/checkout@v5
  - run: echo "Hello, world!"
  - run: exit 1  # <-- This causes the build to fail
```

The `exit 1` command explicitly returns a non-zero exit code, causing the workflow to fail.

## Proposed Fix

Remove the failing step and uncomment the checkout action:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v5
  - run: echo "Hello, world!"
```

## Implementation

The fix requires modifying `.github/workflows/ci.yml` by:
1. Uncommenting the `actions/checkout@v5` step (line 14)
2. Removing the `exit 1` step (line 16)

This will ensure the CI workflow runs successfully.
