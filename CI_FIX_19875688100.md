# CI Fix for Run #19875688100

## Summary
The "Fake CI" workflow is failing due to an intentional `exit 1` command on line 15 of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Error Details
**Run:** https://github.com/austenstone/copilot-cli/actions/runs/19875688100  
**Job:** https://github.com/austenstone/copilot-cli/actions/runs/19875688100/job/

### Error Log
```
buildRun exit 12025-12-02T22:31:25.7185848Z ##[group]Run exit 1
buildRun exit 12025-12-02T22:31:25.7186387Z exit 1
buildRun exit 12025-12-02T22:31:25.7204536Z shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}
buildRun exit 12025-12-02T22:31:25.7205066Z ##[endgroup]
buildRun exit 12025-12-02T22:31:25.7256517Z ##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause
File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
Line 15 contains: `- run: exit 1`

This causes the workflow to exit with code 1, triggering a failure.

## Proposed Fix

### Option 1: Remove the failing step
```yaml
name: Fake CI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello, world!"
```

### Option 2: Replace with success message
```yaml
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello, world!"
      - run: echo "CI passing successfully!"
```

## Manual Application Required
Due to GitHub security restrictions, the automated Copilot CLI cannot modify workflow files without `workflows` permission. A repository maintainer must apply this fix manually.

## Why did the CI workflow go to therapy?
Because it had exit issues! 🚪💥
